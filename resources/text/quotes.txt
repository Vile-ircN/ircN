We were created to be harvested
The past is dead. It was all just a dream
The weak only strive to be weaker
in your world, the day is no threat
in my world, there is an absence of light
Rise from the raging realms of muspell
Set the nine worlds ablaze
Offered myself to myself
you're an empty promise
are we being punished for fate
the guns of love disastrous
nothing here ever lasts
god is empty just like me
and all along, I knew I was wrong
I wont deny the pain
time heals but I'm forever broken
in my mind I am everyone of you
love is suicide
save me from myself
let me die inside
I hurt where I cant feel
my life has been untrue
the sun shines but I dont
cool kids never have the time
you are the perfect drug
I'd rather die than give you control
god money's not concerned with the sick amongst the pure
kinda like a cloud I was up way up in the sky
I built it up now I take it apart climbed up real high now fall down real far
I put my faith in god and my trust in you now there's nothing more fucked up I could do
don't think you're having all the fun you know me I hate everyone
I'm going all the way down I'm leaving today
look through these blackened eyes you'll see ten thousand lies
my lips may promise but my heart is a whore
the devils of truth steal the souls of the free
I have found you can find happiness in slavery
open my eyes wake up in flames
after everything I've done I hate myself for what I've become
there is no god up in the sky tonight
I am so dirty on the inside
I am the voice inside your head
I am the lover in your bed
I am the sex that you provide
I am the hate you try to hide
he sewed his eyes shut because he is afraid to see
he tries to tell me what I put inside of me
he's got the answers to ease my curiosity
he dreamed a god up and called it christianity
god is dead and no one cares
if there is a hell I'll see you there
I hurt myself today to see if I still feel
I focus on the pain the only thing that's real
the needle tears a hole the old familiar sting
try to kill it all away but I remember everything
everyone I know goes away in the end
I will let you down I will make you hurt
this world rejects me
this world threw me away
this world never gave me a chance
this world's gonna have to pay
I got my heart but my heart's no good
you're the only one that's understood
my blood just wants to say hello to you
my fears want to get inside of you
my soul is so afraid to realize how very little good is left of me
I gave myself away now I'm nothing
all that I can do is break myself in two
That which is done out of love, always takes place beyond good and evil.
Our salvation lies not in knowing, but in creating
