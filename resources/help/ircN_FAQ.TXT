  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #1.1 Q. How do i install ircN 8 (beta)?
  
  A.
    1) Install mIRC
       - Install mIRC to it's own location (ie. C:\Program Files\mIRC)
    2) Run ircN installer
       - Tell the installer where to put ircN (a location outside of
         mIRC dir, ie. C:\ircN)
       - Tell the installer where your mIRC installation is
         (Where you installed mIRC in step 1)
       - Start ircN
       - For the first time you join a channel you MUST be connected 
         directly to a irc server, NOT through a bouncer.
 
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #1.2 Q. How do i upgrade to ircN 8 (beta) from a previous version of
  ircN (ircN 7 or earlier) ? 
  
  A.
    At this time you can only upgrade from ircN 8 beta version. 
    We might work on ircN 7 upgrading later on, closer to ircN 8
    becoming "Final".
  
  
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #1.3 Q. How do i upgrade ircN 8 (beta) from a previous ircN 8 version ?
  
  A.
    1) Close ircN if running
    2) Run installer with Upgrade option
    3) Tell the installer where your ircN installation is
    
    NOTE: Do NOT upgrade from ircN 7 to ircN 8; 
    this is for upgrading from a previous ircN 8 build.
  
  
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #2.1 Q. Why does ircN always ask for a username and password when I join a channel?
  
  A.
    Your username isn't set up correctly (possibly you connected through a 
    bouncer when you first started using ircN8)
    OR you are using spaces in the owner name (fixed in ircN 8.00.20060105).

    Alternate Solution:
    Remove all users from the userlist (/userlist) and type /firstjoin
    You MUST give a owner name (without spaces) and a password!
    Just use whatever you want.
    

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #2.2 Q. ircN has unknown commands and missing dialogs, menus. 
     / ircN scripts have been unloaded.
     / How do I (re)load the core script files?

  A.
    ircN's script files have been unloaded either because mIRC did not close 
    correctly or ircN's directory has been changed.

    Solution:
    Type: '//load -rs core.mrc | default.setup' without the quotation marks
    Or revert from a backup if you use the backup module.

    Tips for avoiding the problem in the future:
    ALWAYS close mirc before shutting down windows or your computer
    NEVER click "close now" when windows prompts you about mirc not responding 
    when you are closing mirc or shutting down windows
    
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #2.3 Q. Why am I getting NSET/NCID unknown commands.
  
  A.
  
    sounds like ircN's script files have become unloaded.

    * Make sure you are not using FiSH or any other mIRC encryption script that 
      modifies mirc.exe. If you are unload it and replace mirc.exe with an 
      unmodified version.

    Solution:
    Type: '//load -rs core.mrc | default.setup' without the quotation marks
    If you get any errors when you type this try: 
    '//load -rs core.mrc | write -c $sd(users.mrc) | default.setup'
  
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #2.4 Q. Why does ircN8 keep unbanning certain bans?
  
  A.
    There are a couple of situations that could cause this
  
    1.
    User Bans is disabled
  
    or
  
    2.
    These bans are recognizes by ircN8 as a hostmask that you have.
    The bans ircN8 recognizes are in the form of *!*@*anything_here*. If your 
    hostmask (or anyone on your userlist with the +f flag) has a * in it then 
    ircN8 sees the banmask *!*@*anything_here* MATCHING your protected hostmask
    which could be something like *!*Nick@*isp.com.. because of the astericks.

    Solutions:
    1) Enable 'Allow User Bans' in /setup -> Userlist -> Settings 
       (ircN8 build 20050923 and later)
    2) OR Remove +f from everyone on your userlist with either 
       "/chattr -f <username>" OR edit via the userlist dialog: /userlist
    3) Get channel ops to use better ban masks in the form: 
       *!*@*isp.com instead of *!*@isp*
    4) Set better hostmasks for users with +f (nick*!ident@cool.vhost.com)
  
    PS. In newer versions of ircN +f flag isn't automatically added for the 
        owner during the install procedure. (Therefore not unbanning 
        unecessarily)
  
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #2.5 Q. Why do I get "10053 error, software caused connection abort"?
  
  A.
    Consult the mIRC Forum at 
    http://trout.snt.utwente.nl/ubbthreads/showflat.php?Cat=0&Number=38665&an=0&page=0#38665
    
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #2.6 Q. mIRC does not save window positions.
  
  A.
    Set the window in the position you want it to be saved in. In the upper 
    left corner of the window (or mIRC if you are saving mIRC's position) 
    click the icon and goto 'Position -> Reset'. Now click the same icon and 
    goto 'Position -> Save'.
    
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #2.7 Q. How do I make the mIRC window always open maximized?
  
  A.
    1) Maximize mIRC.
    2) Click in the icon left of the File menu (below the mIRC icon) and goto: 
       'Position -> Save'

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #2.8 Q. 
    Channels and queries in the SWITCHBAR are LARGE and they FILL the switchbar,
    how do I remove this behaviour?
  
  A.
    1) Press ALT + O and goto 'Display'
    2) Turn off 'Fill switchbar'
  
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #2.9 Q. How do I turn off autovoice? when my other client joins, ircN autovoices it.
  
  A.
    Type: '//chattr %owner -v'
  
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #2.10 Q. How do I change the TREEBAR (new) to SWITCHBAR (old)?
  
  A.
    From the top menu, select 'View', enable 'Switchbar', disable 'Treebar'.
  
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #2.11 Q. [DIALOG] doesn't seem to work, how come?
     / Some of the dialogs don't work, how come?
     / /setup command doesn't work, how come?
     / I get something like * Error: $dll is locked when i try to open dialogs.
     
  A.
    Most modern script use dlls to make the script 'prettier' and ease the 
    scripting process, so the use of /dll and $dll have to be enabled for 
    the dialogs to function properly.

    Solution:
    If you have disabled the use of /dll and such, enable it.
    Press ALT + O, Goto 'Other -> Lock' and deselect Disable run,dll,com commands.
    
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #2.12 Q. How do I stop ircN getting in the system tray when minimized?
  
  A. 
    1) Go to mIRC's options (Press ALT + O)
    2) Go to 'Display -> Options -> Tray' and 
       deselect 'Place mIRC in tray when minimized.'
  
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #2.13 Q. What is my ircN8 beta version/build date?
  
  A.
    You can find out the date/version of ircN 8 beta in 3 ways.
    1) '//iecho $nvar(reldate)'               echos the reldate
    2) '/setup'          the version is shows in the about menu
    3) '/sv'       will msg the version to active channel/query.
    
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
  #2.14 Q. How do I change my timestamp so that it stays after restart
       How do I change my timestamp so that it stays after I load a new theme?
       
  A.
    Open /themes dialog and go to the 'Apply' tab.
    Disable the 'Timestamp' checkbox.
    Close the dialog.
    Open mIRC's options (alt+o)
    Go to 'IRC -> Messages'
    and set the Timestamp there, after you've done that, the same timestamp 
    will be used in all themes.

    HOWEVER, if you want to use control codes (colors, bold etc.) you will 
    need to check the Apply Timestamp box and edit the theme you are using.

    For time parameters see mIRC help file's topic: $time (type /mirc $time).
    
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #3.1 Q. Is there a regainnick/getnick command/feature in ircN8?

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #3.3 Q. Where is autojoin?

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #3.4 Q. Can I use ircN 7 addons in ircN 8?
     / do ircN 7 addons work in ircN 8 ?
     
  A.
    No.
    
    The format for the file to be recognized as an ircN 8 module has been 
    changed just for this reason. ircN 8 uses different identifiers and 
    now uses hash tables instead of variables. You may be able to email 
    the author of the ircN 7 addon and get them to update it and 
    release it as an ircN 8 module.
    
    If you are the addon author however, the changes required are usually
    fairly minimal, unless the addon requires changes for added multiserver
    support, which is rarely the case.
    
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #3.5 Q. Where is the addons command? 
     / Why doesnt /addons work?
     / How do I install addons?
     
  A.
    Addons are now referred to as modules in ircN8.
    Use the '/modules' command to load/unload modules in ircN8.
  
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #3.6 Q. How do i set the CTCP CLOAK?
  
  A.
    1) Type /setup
    2) goto 'Message Editor -> CTCP'
    3) Press 'Add/Edit'
    4) Type the name of the CTCP event
    5) Press 'Add' button next the the box (IMPORTANT)
    6) Select the 'Ignore' option
    
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  #3.7 Q. How do I copy my ircN7 settings onto ircN8?
  
  A.
    Load the 'iTransfer' module via '/modules' (as of ircN8 build 20050923)
    
    Due to constant changes in ircN and the beta status of the iTransfer
    module, it's possible that some settings are not imported from ircN 7.
